use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use Psr\Http\Server\MiddlewareInterface;
use Psr\Http\Server\RequestHandlerInterface as Next;

/**
 * Class SomeAuthorizationMiddleware
 */
class SomeAuthorizationMiddleware implements MiddlewareInterface
{
    public function process(Request $request, Next $next): Response
    {
        if (!$this->isAuthorized($request)) {
            // Throw the exception and handle it in an upstream middleware
            throw new Legatus\Http\Unauthorized($request);
        }

        return $next->handle($request);
    }

# Project status & release process

While this library is still under development, it is well tested and should be stable enough to use in production environments.

The current releases are numbered 0.x.y. When a non-breaking change is introduced (adding new methods, optimizing existing code, etc.), y is incremented.

When a breaking change is introduced, a new 0.x version cycle is always started.

It is therefore safe to lock your project to a given release cycle, such as 0.2.*.

If you need to upgrade to a newer release cycle, check the [release history][releases] for a list of changes introduced by each further 0.x.0 version.
